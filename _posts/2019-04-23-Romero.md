title: Data Management for Data Science. 
abstract: <p> The role of data management for data science is gaining relevance as more complex analytical systems are being developed. Techniques such as deep learning heavily rely on the efficient management of data (e.g., distribution of data) and specialised hardware to improve its training time. </p><p>Indeed, any data-intensive system can drastically benefit from the well-grounded theory of data management. In this talk we will explore the current role of data management for data science and focus on the main research lines in this aspect. We will pay special attention to data integration and data governance issues, while providing an overall view of the main challenges and proposed solutions in this field.</p>
bio: <p>Oscar Romero is an associate lecturer at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC).</p><p> He obtained his PhD in Computing from UPC in 2010. Since then, he is a member of the Database Technologies and Information Management (DTIM) and Information Modeling and Processing (IMP) research groups. His research mainly focuses on complex information systems that automate the data management lifecycle, specially in the Business Intelligence and Big Data fields. More specifically, his main interests are OLAP and data warehousing, NOSQL (and any technology beyond relational databases), data integration, self-tuning database systems and semantic-aware systems (based on semantic formalisms such as ontology languages or RDF(S)).</p><p> Currently, he is the UPC coordinator of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Big Data Management and Analytics (BDMA), the Data Science track of the Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics (MIRI-DS) and the life-long learning master in Big Data Management, Technologies and Analytics (BDMTA). He also participates in the Erasmus Mundus Joint PhD in Information Technologies for Business Intelligence - Doctoral Consortium (IT4BI-DC), where he supervised 3 successfully finalised PhD thesis and 8 additional on-going theses.</p><p>He has also participated in several technology transfer projects with relevant companies or organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), SAP, HP Labs, Siemens, Atos and Zurich Insurance among others. Similarly, he has participated in more than 10 competitive projects.</p>
