title: Big Data Variety. The Challenge of On-demand Data Integration
abstract: <p>As big data systems get more complex, the data variety challenge has become the driving factor in current big data projects. From a technical perspective, data variety mainly boils down to the data integration problem, which, unfortunately, is far away from being a resolved problem. Current efforts highlight the need to broaden the perspective beyond the data community and use semantic-aware formalisms, such as knowledge graphs, to tackle this problem. In this talk, we will revise the current state-of-the-art of the data variety challenge and present recent solutions to manage the problem.</p>
