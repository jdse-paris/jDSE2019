title: Big Data Variety: the Challenge of on-demand Data Integration
abstract: <p>The large volumes of urban data, along with vastly increased computing power, open up new opportunities to better understand cities. Encouraging success stories show that data can be leveraged to make operations more efficient, inform policies and planning, and improve the quality of life for residents. However, analyzing urban data often requires a staggering amount of work, from identifying relevant data sets, cleaning and integrating them, to performing exploratory analyses and creating predictive models that must take into account spatio-temporal processes. Our long-term goal is to enable domain experts to crack the code of cities by freely exploring the vast amounts of urban data.  In this talk, we will present methods and systems that combine data management, analytics, and visualization to increase the level of interactivity, scalability, and usability for urban data exploration.</p>
