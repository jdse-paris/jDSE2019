title: Big Data Variety. The Challenge of On-demand Data Integration
abstract: <p>As big data systems get more complex, the data variety challenge has become the driving factor in current big data projects. From a technical perspective, data variety mainly boils down to the data integration problem, which, unfortunately, is far away from being a resolved problem. Current efforts highlight the need to broaden the perspective beyond the data community and use semantic-aware formalisms, such as knowledge graphs, to tackle this problem. In this talk, we will revise the current state-of-the-art of the data variety challenge and present recent solutions to manage the problem.</p>
bio: <p>Oscar Romero is an associate lecturer at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC).</p> <p>He obtained his PhD in Computing from UPC in 2010. Since then, he is a member of the Database Technologies and Information Management (DTIM) and Information Modeling and Processing (IMP) research groups. His research mainly focuses on complex information systems that automate the data management lifecycle, specially in the Business Intelligence and Big Data fields. More specifically, his main interests are OLAP and data warehousing, NOSQL (and any technology beyond relational databases), data integration, self-tuning database systems and semantic-aware systems (based on semantic formalisms such as ontology languages or RDF(S)).</p><p>Currently, he is the UPC coordinator of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Big Data Management and Analytics (BDMA), the Data Science track of the Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics (MIRI-DS) and the life-long learning master in Big Data Management, Technologies and Analytics (BDMTA). He also participates in the Erasmus Mundus Joint PhD in Information Technologies for Business Intelligence - Doctoral Consortium (IT4BI-DC), where he supervised 3 successfully finalised PhD thesis and 8 additional on-going theses.</p> <p>He has also participated in several technology transfer projects with relevant companies or organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), SAP, HP Labs, Siemens, Atos and Zurich Insurance among others. Similarly, he has participated in more than 10 competitive projects.</p>
