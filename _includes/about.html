              <p>The fourth edition of the Paris-Saclay Junior Conference on Data Science and Engineering (JDSE) is addressed to PhD students in their first year, M2 students and third year students at Engineering schools at Paris-Saclay. It will offer these students the opportunity to present their scientific work developed during their internships, or their first year of PhD, and also to grow their critical sense thanks to a professional conference hosting prestigious invited speakers, academics and industry scientists.
