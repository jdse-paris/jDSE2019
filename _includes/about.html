              <p>The fourth edition of the Paris-Saclay Junior Conference on Data Science and Engineering (JDSE) is addressed to PhD students in their first year, M2 students and third year students at Engineering schools at Paris-Saclay. It will offer these students the opportunity to present their scientific work developed during their internships, or their first year of their PhD thesis, and also to grow their critical sense thanks to a professional conference hosting prestigious invited speakers, academics and industry scientists.
