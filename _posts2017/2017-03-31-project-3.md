title: Building Intelligent Systems at Scale with Deep Learning
abstract: Recent advances in Deep Learning are at the heart of the current AI boom. We will review some of these advances in areas such as image understanding, machine translation or robotics, and analyze the factors that can explain the observed progress, from the availability of large amounts of labeled data to new computing paradigms as well as algorithmic and scientific insights. Looking forward, we will discuss the remaining scientific and technical challenges and highlight some of the promising research directions in the field.
