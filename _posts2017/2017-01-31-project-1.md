title: Web-Scale Domain-Specific Information Extraction
abstract: Information Extraction (IE) from unstructured texts is a technology with growing importance in many applications. Three important challenges to IE are the achievement of high quality results, scalability of methods to very large corpora, and integration of IE results with other data for downstream analysis. In this talk, we will highlight recent advances and open questions in these areas by drawing from extensive experiences in developing and applying IE for biomedical research.
