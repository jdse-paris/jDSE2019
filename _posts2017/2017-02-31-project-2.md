title: Machine Learning under Resource Constraints
abstract: Big data are produced by various sources, often distributed over several measuring entities. Where the sensors have restricted capabilities, the compute clusters, where the data are stored is usually very fast. In both cases, energy consumption needs to be restricted. In this talk, the interplay of data analysis at the sensors and in the cloud, together with the application of the analysis is explained. We discuss opportunities for using sophisticated models for learning spatio-temporal models. In particular, we investigate graphical models, which generate the probabilities for connected (sensor) nodes. We even approximate likelihood estimates such that they can be computed on very restricted devices.

Abstract
 
cv Katharina Morik is full professor for computer science at the TU Dortmund University, Germany. She earned her Ph.D. (1981) at the University of Hamburg and her habilitation (1988) at the TU Berlin. Starting with natural language processing, her interest moved to machine learning ranging from inductive logic programming to statistical learning, then to the analysis of very large data collections, high-dimensional data, and resource awareness. She is a member of the National Academy of Science and Engineering and the North-Rhine- Westphalia Academy of Science and Arts. She leads the research center SFB876 on Data Analysis under Resource Constraints comprising 14 projects, 20 professors and about 50 PhD students.
